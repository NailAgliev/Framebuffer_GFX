===================================================

This is a base class, offering Adafruit::GFX support for both:
- https://github.com/marcmerlin/FastLED_NeoMatrix/
- https://github.com/marcmerlin/SmartMatrix_GFX/

On top of GFX functionality backed by a 24bit CRGB array, it includes https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoMatrix mapping for FastLED_NeoMatrix which depends on this class.
